# OLA_UBER_ANALYSIS
Ride Booking Success Rate Optimization (Ola & Uber)
Project Overview

This project seeks to evaluate ride bookings for Ola and Uber to identify major factors affecting ride success rates or cancellations. The solution employs Python for data processing and exploratory data analysis. Additionally, it utilizes Power BI for interactive data visualization. Major issues affecting Ola and Uber rides are identified to recommend data-driven solutions for enhancing the ride completion percentage.

The dashboard components are service reliability, availability of drivers, customer behavior, performance of vehicle types, and high-demand routes.

Project Objective:

To improve ride success rate by identifying:

Major causes of ride cancellations

Driver availability gaps

Low-performing vehicle categories

High-demand but problematic routes

Peak demand periods affecting operations

Tools & Technologies Used:

Python (Pandas, NumPy) – Data cleaning and EDA

Power BI – Dashboard creation and DAX analysis

CSV Files – Data storage

GitHub – Version control and project hosting

Key KPIs Tracked:

Success Rate %

Cancellation Rate

Driver Not Found %

Average Vehicle Arrival Time (V_TAT)

Average Driver Rating

Route Demand Volume

Revenue Performance

Dashboard Features:

Overall ride success performance overview

Vehicle type success comparison

Cancellation reason analysis

Driver availability insights

Peak hour and weekday demand trends

High-demand route identification

Worst-performing locations and vehicle categories

Major Insights:

Driver-related issues contribute to a large share of cancellations.

Certain vehicle types show lower success rates due to limited driver availability.

Peak demand hours experience higher failure rates.

Specific pickup-drop routes have high demand but low success.

Service delays increase cancellation probability.

Business Recommendations:

Increase driver incentives during peak hours

Improve driver onboarding for low-availability vehicle types

Optimize driver positioning in high-demand routes

Enhance ETA accuracy and pickup validation

Monitor service quality using driver ratings
